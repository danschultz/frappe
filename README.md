# Frappé

A functional reactive programming library for Dart. Frappé extends the functionality of Dart's streams, and introduces new concepts like properties/signals.

## Why FRP?

UI applications today are highly interactive and data driven. User input can trigger updates to the DOM, playing animations, invoking network requests, and modifying application state. Using the traditional form of event callbacks and modifying state variables can quickly become difficult to write and maintain.

Functional reactive programming (FRP) makes it clearer to define user and system events that cause state changes. For instance, it's easy to define "when a user performs A, do X and Y, then output Z."

When writing reactive code, you'll find yourself focusing more on the dependencies between events for business logic, and less time on their implementation details.

## Example

Let's write an auto-complete movie widget with Frappé. The widget has an input field for the movie name, and a list element that displays movies that most closely match the user's input. A working version can be found [here](http://danschultz.github.io/frappe/examples/auto_complete/).

```dart
var searchInput = document.querySelector("#searchInput");
var suggestionsElement = document.querySelector("#suggestions");

var onInput = new EventStream(searchInput.onInput)
    .debounce(new Duration(milliseconds: 250)) // Limit the number of network requests
    .map((event) => event.target.value) // Get the text from the input field
    .distinct(); // Ignore duplicate events with the same text

// Make a network request to get the list of movie suggestions. Because requests
// are asynchronous, they can complete out of order. Use `flatMapLatest` to only
// respond to request for the last text change.
var suggestions = onInput.flatMapLatest((input) => querySuggestions(input));

suggestions.listen((movies) =>
    suggestionsElement.children
        ..clear()
        ..addAll(movies.map((movie) => new LIElement()..text = movie));

// Show "Searching ..." feedback while the request is pending
var isPending = searchInput.onInput.isWaitingOn(suggestions);
isPending.where((value) => value).listen((_) {
  suggestionsElement.children
      ..clear()
      ..add(new DivElement()..text = "Searching ...");
});

Future<List<String>> querySuggestions(String input) {
  // Query some API that returns suggestions for 'input'
}
```

## API

You can explore the full API [here][documentation].

### `Reactable`

The `Reactable` class extends from Stream and is inherited by `EventStream` and `Property`. Because these classes extend from Dart's `Stream`, you can pass them directly to other APIs that expect a `Stream`.

### `EventStream`

An `EventStream` represents a series of discrete events. They're like a `Stream` in Dart, but extends its functionality with the methods found on `Reactable`.

Event streams can be created from a property via `Property.asEventStream()`, or through one of its constructor methods. If an event stream is created from a property, its first event will be the property's current value.

An `EventStream` will inherit the behavior of the stream from which it originated. So if an event stream was created from a broadcast stream, it can support multiple subscriptions. Likewise, if an event stream was created from a single-subscription stream, only one subscription can be added to it. Take a look at the [article](https://www.dartlang.org/articles/broadcast-streams/) on single-subscription streams vs broadcast streams to learn more about their different behaviors.

### `Property`

A `Property` represents a value that changes over time. They're similar to event streams, but they remember their current value. Whenever a subscription is added to a property, it will receive the property's current value as its first event.

Properties can be created through one of its constructors, or from an event stream via `EventStream.asProperty()`. Depending on how the property was created, it may or may not have a starting value. Separate methods are available for creating properties with an initial value, i.e. `Property.fromStreamWithInitialValue()` and `EventStream.asPropertyWithInitialValue()`. Properties can support having a null initial value, and is partly the motivation for having separate construction methods.

Internally, properties are implemented as broadcast streams and can receive multiple subscriptions.

If you were to model text input using properties and streams, the individual key strokes would be events, and the resulting text is a property.

## Learning More

Definitely take a look at the API [documentation], and play around with some of the [examples]. It's also worth checking out [BaconJS] and [RxJS]. They're both mature FRP libraries, and offer some great resources on the subject.

## Running Tests

Tests are run through the Grinder `build` task. This will run the Dart Analyzer, linter and unit tests.

* Install *grinder*: `pub global activate grinder`
* Run *grinder*: `grind build`
